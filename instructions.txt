Steps to run the code:-



1. To run the code in Spyder notebook
	
->first open Spyder notebook and open santanderPython.py file in directory
	
->now import all the packages if packages are not installed then first install all the packages by  		
	
using "pip install packagename" command.
	
-> once imported all the packages now set the path where train and datasets are saved.
	
-> Now run all the codes by clicking shift+enter(or F9) buttons together.



2. To run the code in R studio.
	
->open Rstudio and open santanderR.r file by going into files and then open
	
->Now load all libraries. if libraries are not installed then first install libraries by using 	
	
	"install.packages("package name")" command.
	
->Now after importing all the libraries set the path where train and test datasets are saved.
	
->Now run all the code by clicking ctrl+enter buttons together.




*****************************To run the code from Dos prompt******************


1. To run the python code:-
	
-> Either run santanderPython.py code 	
-> To run santanderPython.py first open it and replace oschdir("path") with your path where you have stored 		

	the train and test data. Now open the terminal from the directory where your code is saved and type 		

	command "python3 santanderPython.py"
	
	
2. To run R code from terminal:-
	
->Find the "littler" in repository and install it.
	
-> Once installed litter package open santanderR.r file and replace path from your path
	
-> now open terminal from the location where you have stored the r code
	
-> Now run command "Rscript santanderR.r

"

**********************************How to Deploy the model****************************


All the task done in spyder or R might not be understandable to non-technical users or clients.
So 
we need to deploy the model for production using GUI. We can use two types of tool that is
Online(cloud) tools or offline tools.

->In online tools we use cloud services where our R or Python code runs as a back end engine. And online tool takes output of R or 
  python and presents it in Graphical format.
	
->Similarly, in offline tools we use different programming languages like html,php,css for developing User Interface
	
-> Our R our python code will be linked with this UI and will run as a back end engine.

	Interface. Our R our python code will be linked with this UI and will run as a back end engine.
	
   Output of R or Python code will be shown in Graphical format to users.
